**Description:** This chart displays the Consumer Price Index (CPI) year-over-year inflation rate, a key measure of price changes in the economy. The chart includes NBER recession shading and a 2% inflation target reference line.

**Relevance for Economic Analysis:** CPI inflation is the primary measure of consumer price changes and is closely watched by the Federal Reserve for monetary policy decisions. The 2% target represents the Fed's inflation goal.

**Direction of Risk:** Persistently high inflation erodes purchasing power and may lead to tighter monetary policy. Very low or negative inflation (deflation) can indicate weak demand and economic stagnation.

**Formulas Used:** Year-over-Year % Change = ((CPI_t - CPI_{t-12}) / CPI_{t-12}) * 100

**Data Cleaning Information:** Data is sourced directly from FRED (CPIAUCSL series) and transformed to year-over-year percentage change.

**What does this add that other charts might not?** Provides context for inflation trends relative to the Fed's target and historical recession periods.

**Description:** This chart shows the Federal Funds Effective Rate, the interest rate at which depository institutions lend reserve balances to other depository institutions overnight. NBER recession shading is included for context.

**Relevance for Economic Analysis:** The Federal Funds Rate is the primary tool of US monetary policy. Changes in this rate affect borrowing costs throughout the economy and signal the Fed's stance on economic conditions.

**Direction of Risk:** Rising rates indicate tightening monetary policy to combat inflation, which can slow economic growth. Falling rates indicate easing policy to stimulate the economy.

**Formulas Used:** N/A - Direct observation of the effective rate.

**Data Cleaning Information:** Data is sourced directly from FRED (FEDFUNDS series) without additional transformations.

**Description:** This dual-axis chart combines GDP (shown as bars on the left axis) with the Unemployment Rate (shown as a line on the right axis), allowing visualization of their inverse relationship.

**Relevance for Economic Analysis:** GDP and unemployment are two of the most important macroeconomic indicators. They typically move inversely - when GDP grows, unemployment tends to fall (Okun's Law).

**Direction of Risk:** Falling GDP combined with rising unemployment signals recession risk. Strong GDP growth with low unemployment indicates a healthy economy but may also signal inflation pressures.

**Formulas Used:** N/A - Direct observations of both series.

**Data Cleaning Information:** GDP is quarterly data; Unemployment is monthly data averaged to quarterly for alignment.

**Description:** This scatter plot examines the relationship between GDP growth and CPI inflation, with a regression line to show the correlation. Each point represents a time period.

**Relevance for Economic Analysis:** Understanding the relationship between growth and inflation is central to macroeconomic policy. The Phillips Curve suggests a trade-off, though this relationship has evolved over time.

**Direction of Risk:** High growth with high inflation may require contractionary policy. Low growth with high inflation (stagflation) is particularly challenging for policymakers.

**Formulas Used:** GDP Growth = ((GDP_t - GDP_{t-4}) / GDP_{t-4}) * 100; Inflation as YoY CPI change.

**Data Cleaning Information:** Both series transformed to year-over-year percentage changes and aligned by date.

**What does this add that other charts might not?** Explores the growth-inflation trade-off directly, which is not visible in time series charts of individual indicators.
